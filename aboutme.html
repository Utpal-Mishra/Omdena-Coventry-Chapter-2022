•	Working on performing interpretations on COVID-19 - impact of air pollutants for COVID deaths; visual understanding on cases, deaths, testings and medical services; impact on employment and currencies; and forecasting cases using ARIMA model - based on data provided as well as extracted from multiple sources.
•	Building 120+ Machine Learning Models - Traditional, Neural Networks and Ensemble Models - for Classification using R.
•	Working with Mathematica to build Breast Cancer Classification Model - Traditional and Ensemble Models.
	
Dissertation: Working on carrying out research on the topic Optimal Control Therapy for Cancer Treatment. The main goal of research project was to build a better Optimization Functions to enhance the Pharmacokinetics - phase of Pharmacology - along with finding the most suitable time intervals for the injections of different measure (in mg) of drug in addition to retracing some of the valuable results from the reference paper.

Dissertation: Building a Breast Cancer Classifier from Histopathological Images using Deep Learning (VGG, ResNet and DenseNet) and Hybrid Models (VGG/ ResNet/ DenseNet + Random Forest/ SVM). The achieved value of F1-Score from DenseNet + Random Forest Model was found to be better than any of the existing Breast Cancer Classifiers on Medical Data.
